## Massachusetts School Project 

When I first became I math teacher, I knew I was going to have my work cut out for me. Sure enough, teaching a commonly hated subject to mostly college freshman wasn't easy. What I didn't realize at the beginning, however, is how different each student's background was going to be. Some students were legacy, some were first generation, some came from wealthy school districts and yet others came from economically disadvantaged areas. I began to wonder how these different backgrounds might affect their performance while in college, or whether the students attended college at all. 

In this project, I've created an interactive Tableau dashboard using real data from the state of Massachusetts from the year 2017. This dataset includes 302 attributes for 1861 different public schools. I've been tasked with producing a report for the Department of Education Superintendent that contains the following:

How does class size affect college admission?

What are the top math schools in the state?

What schools are struggling the most?

Here's what I found:

Larger class sizes have a small but positive correlation with high school students going on to attend college.

Each grade level has a different top math district namely: Community Day Charter Gateway District for grade 3, Community Day Charter R. Kingdom Webster District for grade 4, Marblehead Community Charter Public District for grade 5, Southampton for grade 6, Hilltown Cooperative Charter Public District for grade 7, Pioneer Valley Chinese Immersion Charter District for grade 8 and Saugus for grade 10.*

Several schools are struggling overall, with 36 schools boasting a less than 50% high school graduation rate. The lowest graduation rate belongs to Springfield Public Day High School with a mere 9%.

*The dataset does not contain the correct data to report on grade 9

Figure 1. Picture of Tableau dashboard with graphs showing graduation rates, college attendance rates, and MCAS math pass rates for 3rd grade.
The graphs utilized in this dashboard paint a concerning picture for the Massachusetts Education Department. Looking at the bar chart on the far left, we see schools reporting graduation rates as low as 9%. On a more positive note, there are 10 schools who report a 100% graduation rate, bringing the average up to 83% across the state.

The scatterplot in the center of the dashboard reports the percent of college attendance after graduation in respect to their high school class size. While the trendline shows a positive correlation between larger class sizes and higher college enrollment rates, the R^2 value is only 0.19, which tells us that just under 20% of college attendance can be attributed to class sizes. The colors present on this graph provide a little more context to help determine factors of college attendance in relation to economic disadvantages for students. The dark blue represent a school that has fewer students determined to be economically disadvantaged, while the gold represents a school with more students in this category. We can clearly see that more blue schools are above the trendline and more gold schools below, telling us that economic disadvantage plays a significant role in students going on to attend college. 

Finally, the line graph on the right hand side shows the average percent passing the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) for grade 3, although there is an option on the interactive dashboard to change which grade level you are looking at. This graph shows that for the 3rd grade, only two districts have more than 50% of their students earning a passing score on the test, which is more than concerning. 


Reflection
The analysis on this dataset is far from comprehensive, yet paints an alarming picture of the Massachusetts Public Education system. It would be advantageous to dig even deeper to determine what interventions need to be implemented - and at what grade level - to increase MCAS performance and graduation rates across the state.
